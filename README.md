# Gold Pointer MT5

This is a custom indicator for MetaTrader 5 (MT5) called 'Gold Pointer MT5' developed by Forex Robot Easy (forexroboteasy.com). It is designed to identify profitable entry points for both BUY and SELL orders in the forex market.

## Indicator Initialization

The indicator initializes by setting up the necessary indicator buffers and styles. It uses a single buffer, Buffer1, to display arrows on the chart. The arrows are drawn using the DRAW_ARROW style with arrow code 233. The indicator also sets the number of digits for displaying prices based on the current symbol.

## Indicator Calculation

The main calculation is performed in the OnInit() function. It starts by checking the number of counted bars and returns an error if the count is negative. It then calculates the number of bars that need to be processed based on the difference between the total number of bars and the counted bars.

In the main loop, it iterates over the selected bars and performs technical and mathematical analysis to determine buy and sell signals. The CheckBuySignal() and CheckSellSignal() functions are used to calculate the signals based on technical and mathematical analysis. The signals are then used to display arrows on the chart indicating the entry points for confirmed signals.

## Custom Functions

The CheckBuySignal() and CheckSellSignal() functions are custom functions used to calculate the buy and sell signals respectively. They both perform technical and mathematical analysis to determine the signals. The TechnicalAnalysis() function calculates the technical analysis using moving averages, while the MathematicalAnalysis() function calculates the mathematical analysis using the average of the high and low prices.
